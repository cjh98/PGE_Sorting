Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is the source code for a sorting algorithm visualizer, like those you see on Youtube where each element is represented by a rectangle and its value is shown as the rectangle's height. I only have 3 sorting algorithms implemented because I got bored. A sample video is included as an mp4 file in the repo.
